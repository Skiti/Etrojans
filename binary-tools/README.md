# BINARY TOOLS

## Binary Diff
The *binary-diff* Python script identifies differences between two e-scooter binary firmware.
This tool checks if firmware on different e-scooter models is the same or not.
It also helps reverse-engineering more recent firmware versions by directly comparing them to previous versions. 

## Binary Patcher
The *binary-patcher* Python script generates custom firmware compatible with most Xiaomi e-scooters (only M365 and ES3 have been properly tested).
We used it to add new malicious capabilities to the stock Xiaomi BCTRL firmware, enabling our E-Trojans attacks.
