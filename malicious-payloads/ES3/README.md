## ES3 MALICIOUS FIRMWARE
Currently, we released six malicious firmware for the Xiaomi ES3 e-scooter model.
* DES1 drops all messages received by the BCTRL. E-scooter becomes irresponsive.
* DES5 prevents battery charging.
* DES7 removes sleep mode, enforcing the e-scooter into always staying on a power-consuming mode.
* VSP spoofs voltage measurements displayed by the Mi Home app.
* UTI exposes the e-scooters serial numbers and its mileage through BLE advertisements.
* RECOVERY-UV is the recovery firmware that can charge the e-scooter's battery even if undervolted.
