# M365 MALICIOUS FIRMWARE
Currently, we released eight malicious firmware for the Xiaomi M365 e-scooter model.
* DES1 drops all messages received by the BCTRL. E-scooter becomes irresponsive.
* DES2 enables BMON ship mode. E-scooter becomes irresponsive.
* DES4 software-locks the e-scooter preventing it from running.
* DES5 prevents battery charging.
* DES7 removes sleep mode, enforcing the e-scooter into always staying on a power-consuming mode.
* VSP spoofs voltage measurements displayed by the Mi Home app.
* [redacted] UBR undervolts the battery until the user pays a ransom (or the battery dies). Any battery damage is permanent. Safety hazard.
* RECOVERY-UV is the recovery firmware that can charge the e-scooter's battery even if undervolted.
