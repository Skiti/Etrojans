# MALICIOUS PAYLOADS

## Warning
Flashing our firmware will (in most cases) require to restore the e-scooter via an ST-Link debugger.
Some malicious payloads WILL permanently damage the battery of your e-scooter.
Do not attempt this without proper understanding and evaluation setup, or if you value your e-scooter's performance.

## Usage
The M365 and ES3 folders contain the malicious payloads for the M365 and the ES3 e-scooter models, respectively.
The payloads are firmware binary files that can be flashed on the e-scooter by our Ransom App (also released in this repository) or any other third-party app that allows for firmware updates.
As soon as the firmware is flashed on the e-scooter, the attack begins automatically.
